# Gold Collector
This my first ever game made with C and raylib. The code quality is really bad and the game itself is made for learning purposes.

# How to build
###  1) Clone the repository
###  2) Create and enter a build folder:
```	console
mkdir build && cd build
```
### 3) Build:
```console
cmake .. -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=true
cmake --build .
```
### 4) Simply Run:
```console
./GoldCollector
```
